# Not
# The boolean operator not returns True for false statements and False for true statements.
#
# For example:
#
# not False will evaluate to True, while not 41 > 40 will return False.

# Instructions
# Let's get some practice with not.
#
# Set bool_one equal to the result of not True
# Set bool_two equal to the result of not 3**4 < 4**3
# Set bool_three equal to the result of not 10 % 3 <= 10 % 2
# Set bool_four equal to the result of not 3**2 + 4**2 != 5**2
# Set bool_five equal to the result of not not False

bool_one = 41 < 40
# not 81 < 64 is True
bool_two = True
# not 1 <= 0 is True
bool_three = True
# not 25 != 25 is True
bool_four = True

bool_five = 41 < 40
